When I was looking for some inspirations for this website I found the link list from Gpfault.

> This website upholds the time-honored Web 1.0 tradition of linking to similar sites.

I really like the idea of sharing websites. It's fun to just stumble from page to page finding more interesting content. Especially in times where most of the Internet consumption comes from only a handful of Big Tech Company.

You can find the list here: [More_People.html]({{site.url}}/More_People.html)
